# Nexus Server Manager v3.0.6

## Added

- **ARK ASA Cluster: Apply Cluster workflow** — new "Apply Cluster" button runs a 5-step process: validate → sync cluster rules → sync mods → create cluster directory → refresh status.
- **ARK ASA Cluster: Sync Mods to Cluster** — enter comma-separated CurseForge mod IDs in the Cluster Mods field and push them to every map in one click.
- **ARK ASA Cluster: Mod Consistency Check** — detects which maps are missing mods that other maps have, with a per-issue breakdown.
- **ARK ASA Cluster: Dedicated Logging** — cluster and mod sync operations are now written to `Logs/ark-cluster.log` and `Logs/ark-mods.log`.
- **ARK ASA Cluster: IsBusy guard** — all cluster commands are disabled while an operation is in progress, preventing double-clicks and race conditions.
- **ARK ASA Cluster: Status color on map cards** — each map card shows green when running, grey when stopped.
- **Documentation** — new `docs/` folder with five guides: cluster research, mods research, cluster setup guide, mod manager guide, and cluster troubleshooting.

## Changed

- Cluster start/stop/restart/backup operations now log to `ark-cluster.log`.
- Adding a map to a cluster now logs to `ark-cluster.log`.
- Validation auto-runs a mod consistency check when two or more maps are present.

## Known Issues

- Code signing is prepared but not configured until a certificate is available.
